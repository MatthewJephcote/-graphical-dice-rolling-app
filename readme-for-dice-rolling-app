##README for Graphical Dice Rolling App##

INSTRUCTIONS: Click one die/some or all of the dice to randomly generate a number.

I built the app on React, via the 'create-react-app'.

I also used Tailwind to set all the styling (configuring it to work with the 'create-react-app').

I also made the app's design responsive, suitable for all device sizes.

I was especially proud of my achievement of converting randomly-generated numbers into a two-dimensional graphical output, by using 'useState', 'props' and 'ternary operators' in conjunction with 'flexbox', 'border radius' and other CSS styling, all applied using Tailwind utility classes, which I was particularly pleased to discover could be used as 'props'.

I would like to take the project further by enabling the user to roll all the dice simultaneously by clicking/touching any part of the screen area surrounding the individual dice (each one of which I want to remain independently-rollable) - at present, such multiple dice rolling funtionality is limited to the user refreshing the screen.

I enjoyed creating reusable components for this project, which is a feature of React that I highly value, for its time-efficiency, 'mathematical elegance' and scope for further development of my project.
